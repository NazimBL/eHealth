# eHealth

E-Health is a medical IOT system , a solution proposed for people who need frequent medical 
examination at home, especially for those who can't afford displacment to medical institutions due to either the distance or a certain handicap.
or more generally for any persons that wants a continious track of his/her health.

Our kit is composed of 2 products , an IOT monitoring box and smart bracelet connected to a mobile application

1)the medical box contains different sensors inputs to permit measurement of :

Heartbeat , blood saturation ,blood pressure ,temperature ,humidty and a glucometer.

As mentionned before the main objectif is to provide medical feedback from patients in addition to exmaination and diagnostics at home .
data are collected when the patient uses the box , then data is sent to the approriate 
institution (maybe a private doctor , a public hospital , clinics etc ....).

The box is provided with a Tablet that contains a user interface to display the data measured and also a user guide.

2)the second solution is more fit for people who needs more frequent monitors or for people who just need a flexible way of
checking their health state.

The watch provides monitoring only for Heartbeat , temperature and humidity , as data are sent to a mobile phone by bluetooth.
In addition to realtime monitring , the bracelet sends sos sms in case of dangerous health state ( too high heartbeat frequency , temperature etc ..)
and medecine time scheduling,notifications etc...

On both cases , important data are saved into a database , that can be used for medical predictions and epidemy detection in case of 
geographically close similar symptoms.
